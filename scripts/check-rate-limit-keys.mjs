/**
 * Report rate-limit keys this build cannot resolve.
 *
 * PAS rate-limit keys are keccak hashes. The decoder identifies one by
 * recomputing its preimage, which means it can only name a key whose base name
 * is in `RATE_LIMIT_KEYS` and whose operand addresses are in the contract
 * registry. When governance seeds a key that satisfies neither, the decoder
 * renders an unresolved `bytes32` and marks the transaction high risk. That is
 * the safe behaviour, but it is also a signal that this repository has work to
 * do, and nothing surfaces it today.
 *
 * This script reads every `RateLimitDataSet` event a watched RateLimits
 * contract has ever emitted and runs each distinct key through the real
 * resolver. Anything that comes back null is reported.
 *
 * Checking the chain rather than diffing diamond-pau source is deliberate: it
 * catches a new key name, a new operand address, and a name used at a new
 * arity, without needing to anticipate which of those happened. A source diff
 * would fire for every name the facets declare, including the ones no PAU has
 * ever used.
 *
 * Scanning all history each run keeps this stateless. These contracts hold tens
 * of events, not millions, so there is no last-scanned-block file to commit and
 * nothing to fall out of sync.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-rate-limit-keys.mjs            # print findings
 *   node scripts/check-rate-limit-keys.mjs --issues   # also open GitHub issues
 *
 * Requires ETH_RPC_URL. `--issues` additionally requires the `gh` CLI to be
 * authenticated.
 *
 * A transport problem exits 0 and reports nothing. An unresolved key that
 * `--issues` cannot file exits 1 and prints the issue to the log and the job
 * summary instead, so the failed run is the alert.
