# Sky Safe Transaction Decoder

> **"Don't trust, verify!"** - Independently verify Safe transaction hashes before signing.

TypeScript tool for calculating and verifying Safe multisig transaction hashes with security analysis and protocol-specific decoding. Available as a CLI, web UI, and core library.

Based on [pcaversaccio/safe-tx-hashes-util](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/safe-tx-hashes-util).

## What It Does

1. Fetches transaction data from the [Safe Transaction Service API](https://docs.safe.global/core-api/transaction-service-overview)
2. Calculates EIP-712 hashes (Domain, Message, Safe TX) independently
3. Verifies the calculated hash matches the API-provided hash
4. Re-encodes decoded parameters and compares with raw calldata
5. Runs security analysis (delegate calls, gas token attacks, owner modifications)
6. Displays results with protocol-specific decoding when available, falling back to a
   verified ABI from Sourcify when nothing else decodes the call

**Safe versions**: v0.1.0 through v1.5.0

## Quick Start

### CLI

> **Always pin the version.** Unpinned `npx` runs whatever the registry serves
> at request time, which means a malicious publish could be executed before
> anyone notices. The examples below pin to a known-good version — bump it
> intentionally when you upgrade. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for the
> recommended verification flow (build from source) for high-assurance use.

```bash
npx @shield3/sky-safe-cli@0.4.1 verify \
  --address 0xf65475e74C1Ed6d004d5240b06E3088724dFDA5d \
  --nonce 520
```

Or install globally with a pinned version:

```bash
npm install -g @shield3/sky-safe-cli@0.4.1
sky-safe verify --address 0x... --nonce 520
```

### Web UI

- Cloudflare Pages: [sky-safe-tx-decoder.pages.dev](https://sky-safe-tx-decoder.pages.dev/)
- IPFS: [sky-safe-tx-decoder](https://bafybeicf5qkrydd7iawpxfhv2y5wv3bs6i3kjcaz6xsapu3jcvrg5oautm.ipfs.dweb.link/)

Or run locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @shield3/sky-safe-ui dev
```

#### Offline single-file build

For the highest-assurance setup — no hosting provider, no server, no `npm` to
run — build a single self-contained HTML file you open directly in a browser:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @shield3/sky-safe-ui build:offline
# → packages/ui/dist-offline/index.html  (double-click to open)
```

Everything (JS + CSS) is inlined into that one file, so it runs from `file://`
with no external requests for app code. Audit it once, optionally pin its hash,
and run it from disk — the verification code is yours, not re-served by a CDN on
every visit. It still fetches transaction data from the Safe Transaction Service
API, so an internet connection is required; only the app code is local.

##### Verifying a release build

This tool is what you use to decide whether to sign a transaction, so the
integrity of the tool itself is security-critical: a tampered build could show
"✓ hashes match" when they don't and trick you into signing. So a release isn't
just a file you have to trust — it ships with a cryptographic proof of where it
came from. Each tagged release attaches the offline `index.html`, its `.sha256`,
and a keyless **build-provenance attestation**.

Three independent layers, weakest to strongest:

- **SHA-256 checksum — integrity.** Confirms the file wasn't altered versus the
  published value. (On its own, weak: whoever can swap the file can change the
  number next to it.)
- **Build-provenance attestation — authenticity + origin.** Cryptographically
  proves this exact file was produced by **GitHub Actions**, building **this
  repo** at a **specific commit**, via the official release workflow — not from
  someone's laptop or modified source. It is _keyless_ (signed by the workflow
  run's verified identity via Sigstore + GitHub OIDC — no secret key a
  maintainer could leak) and recorded in a public transparency log.
- **Reproducible build — don't trust, verify.** The build is deterministic, so
  you can rebuild from source and get a byte-identical file. You don't have to
  trust the published binary at all.

After downloading, verify before trusting:

```bash
# Integrity — matches the published checksum
shasum -a 256 -c sky-safe-tx-decoder-<tag>.html.sha256

# Provenance — confirms GitHub Actions built this exact file from this repo/commit
gh attestation verify sky-safe-tx-decoder-<tag>.html --repo sky-ecosystem/sky-safe-tx-decoder

# Strongest — reproduce it yourself and compare the hash
git checkout <tag>
pnpm --filter @shield3/sky-safe-ui build:offline
shasum -a 256 packages/ui/dist-offline/index.html   # should match the release
```

This protects against a swapped or backdoored release file, a hand-uploaded
build from a compromised maintainer account, and tampering between source and
binary. It does **not** prove the source code itself is bug-free (audit or trust
the code separately), and verification is a one-time check before you open the
file — the browser doesn't re-check it at runtime.

#### Address Config CSVs

The web UI loads two **independent**, session-only CSV files by drag-and-drop.
They share one schema but play different roles, so updating one never disturbs
the other:

| File | Role | In the app |
| ---- | ---- | ---------- |
| **Address book** | Managed externally (team-owned). Labels known addresses during review. | Read-only. Replace by loading a fresh file. |
| **My Safes** | Your personal Safe shortcuts (the home-page dropdown). | Editable (add/remove) and exportable. |

Each file self-identifies with a marker comment on the first line, so the UI can
reject a file dropped on the wrong slot:

```csv
# sky-safe-config: address-book
address,label,verification_date,status
0xCe01C90dE7FD1bcFa39e237FE6D8D9F569e8A6a3,Sky LockstakeEngine,2026-05-01,active
```

```csv
# sky-safe-config: my-safes
type,network,address,label,verification_date,status
safe,ethereum,0xf65475e74C1Ed6d004d5240b06E3088724dFDA5d,Treasury Safe,2026-05-10,active
```

See [`examples/address-book-template.csv`](examples/address-book-template.csv)
and [`examples/my-safes-template.csv`](examples/my-safes-template.csv). Older
address books with only `address,label,verification_date,status` still load.

Config is kept in memory for the current browser session and is **not** persisted
to local storage — the CSV files you keep externally are the source of truth.
This is intentional for a signing tool: a cached copy could be silently tampered
with or drift stale, so each session you re-load fresh files.

##### Managing My Safes

- **Settings page** (top-right link): add a Safe (network + address + label),
  edit a Safe's label, remove Safes, and export My Safes back to CSV.
- **Capture an unsaved Safe**: when you open a Safe that isn't in My Safes, a
  banner offers to label it and add it to the session list. Adding does **not**
  download anything — you export once, when you're ready, from Settings (or the
  config bar).
- **Export** (config bar or Settings): writes My Safes as a CSV that re-imports
  exactly (round-trip), with the kind marker. Remember to export to persist your
  in-session changes.
- Because the address book and My Safes are separate files, you can update the
  managed address book anytime without losing your Safes.

## Security Analysis

The tool detects:

- **Untrusted delegate calls** - Flags delegate calls to contracts not on the trusted list
- **Gas token attacks** - Custom gas token + custom refund receiver combinations
- **Owner/threshold modifications** - Direct and nested (via MultiSend) changes to Safe owners

### Example Warnings

The `examples/` directory contains crafted transactions that trigger each warning type:

```bash
sky-safe verify --file examples/gas-token-attack.json
sky-safe verify --file examples/untrusted-delegatecall.json
sky-safe verify --file examples/owner-modification.json
sky-safe verify --file examples/guard-set.json
sky-safe verify --file examples/module-enable.json
sky-safe verify --file examples/multiple-issues.json
```

## Custom Decoders

The decoder registry provides protocol-specific human-readable transaction explanations. A
decoder is pinned to one contract address on one network — it never guesses an ABI from a
selector lookup. Every decoding is re-encoded and byte-compared against the raw calldata
before it is shown.

Currently included:

| Protocol                     | Contract                                     | Signatures                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Sky Protocol LockstakeEngine | `0xCe01C90dE7FD1bcFa39e237FE6D8D9F569e8A6a3` | 13 — urn management, staking, borrowing, delegation, rewards, multicall |
| Sky Protocol SPBEAM          | `0x36B072ed8AFE665E3Aa6DaBa79Decbec63752b22` | 7 — `set`, `file` (two overloads), `rely`, `deny`, `kiss`, `diss` |
| Sky Protocol StUsdsRateSetter | `0x30784615252B13E1DbE2bDf598627eaC297Bf4C5` | 7 — `set`, `file` (two overloads), `rely`, `deny`, `kiss`, `diss` |
| Sky Protocol PAS Configurator | `0xb7E61Df6CAb0A51E9A5dab1A7DD3f942dDe5b929` | 2 — `setRateLimit`, `callControllerAction` |
| MultiSend                    | Standard Safe MultiSend                      | Batch transaction decoding                            |

**SPBEAM** sets stability fees and the savings rate within governance-configured bounds.
The Safe Transaction Service does not decode it. Rate values show basis points and
percentage; ilk identifiers show their ASCII label alongside the full `bytes32`.

**StUsdsRateSetter** sets the stUSDS savings rate, ilk duty, debt ceiling and supply cap
within governance-configured bounds. The Safe Transaction Service holds no ABI for this
contract at all.

**PAS Configurator** is the cBEAM entry point of the Parallelized Allocation System. It
moves a Parallelized Allocation Unit's rate limits within governance-set ceilings without a
spell. Rate-limit keys are keccak hashes rather than ASCII, so the decoder resolves them by
recomputing the preimage; `maxAmount` and `slope` are scaled by the key's own denomination,
which is not the target contract's; and `callControllerAction` surfaces `keccak256(data)`,
the value BeamState authorises on.

See [`packages/core/src/decoders/PAS.md`](packages/core/src/decoders/PAS.md) for the key
table, denominations, rendering rules, and scope.

When no decoder covers a contract and the Safe Transaction Service returns nothing, the
Sourcify fallback fetches the contract's verified ABI and decodes with that instead. See
[Sourcify fallback](#sourcify-fallback) below.

See the [core package README](packages/core/README.md#creating-a-custom-decoder) for how to add your own.

## Sourcify Fallback

Web UI only. When the Safe Transaction Service returns no decoded data and no built-in
decoder covers the contract, the app fetches the contract's verified ABI from
[Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev) and decodes with that.

- Sourcify serves the ABI of source that has been verified against the contract's
  **on-chain bytecode**. This is stronger than a selector database: it is not "someone
  submitted a signature for these four bytes", it is "this is the ABI of the exact contract
  deployed at this address".
- **Proxies are followed.** EIP-1967 proxies are resolved to their implementation, so
  proxied calls decode instead of showing as raw bytes. The implementation address is read
  from chain state via a public RPC and is shown alongside the decoding.
- **Contracts missing from Sourcify are imported.** On a miss, the app asks Sourcify to
  import and verify the source from a block explorer, then retries. No Etherscan API key is
  needed.
- **The result is re-encode-verified**, exactly like a Safe API decoding. A decoding that
  does not re-encode to the signed bytes is shown as a hard warning, never as a decoding.

Controlled by a Settings toggle, **on by default**. The request to Sourcify reveals which
contract — and so which transaction — is being inspected. A signer who does not want that
egress can turn it off, and then no request is made.

The CLI does not use this fallback ([#19](https://github.com/0xShield3/sky-safe-tx-decoder/issues/19)).

## Publishing to npm

Use `pnpm pack` then `npm publish` on the tarball. This ensures `workspace:*` dependencies are resolved to real versions. Do not use `npm publish` directly from a package directory.

```bash
# Core (publish first)
cd packages/core && pnpm pack && npm publish shield3-sky-safe-core-*.tgz --access public && rm *.tgz

# CLI
cd ../cli && pnpm pack && npm publish shield3-sky-safe-cli-*.tgz --access public && rm *.tgz
```

## Trust Assumptions

Users must trust:

- This TypeScript implementation
- [viem](https://viem.sh) cryptographic library
- Safe Transaction Service API data — however, the tool independently re-encodes decoded parameters and verifies they match the raw calldata and EIP-712 hashes, so API-provided decoded data is not blindly trusted
- Hardware wallet secure screen

When the [Sourcify fallback](#sourcify-fallback) is enabled, two further parties are
trusted for how a decoding is **labelled and rendered**:

- **Sourcify**, for the ABI.
- **The public RPC**, for a proxy's implementation address.

The re-encode check pins the *bytes*, not their interpretation. It proves that the decoded
call re-encodes to exactly the calldata being signed — selector included. It does not prove
that the ABI describes what the contract does.

What a hostile ABI can change:

- **Parameter names**, freely. The names are not part of the selector.
- **The function name and the argument types**, at the cost of a 4-byte selector collision.
  Roughly 2^32 hashes, which is cheap. Where the head encoding layout is unchanged, this
  alters the displayed value itself — declaring `int256` where the contract has `uint256`
  renders the word `0xffff…ff9c` as `-100` rather than a number close to 2^256. The
  decoding still re-encodes to the signed bytes and is still marked verified.

A decoding is therefore never a substitute for knowing what the contract does. Turning the
fallback off in Settings removes both parties.
