/**
 * Address Book Check
 *
 * When a signer has loaded an address book, every address the transaction
 * touches is expected to be a known, active entry.
 *
 * Addresses are pulled from:
 *   - top-level transaction `to`
 *   - nested MultiSend `to`s
 *   - additionalAddresses passed by the caller (decoded params: transfer.to,
 *     approve.spender, etc.)
 *
 * Per-address status:
 *   - missing from the book entirely      -> "unverified"  (medium warning)
 *   - present but marked status:inactive  -> "inactive"    (high warning)
 *   - present and active, OR matched by a built-in protocol tag -> "verified"
 *
 * Silent (no warnings, no risk) when no address book is loaded — otherwise
 * every transaction would flag every address as unknown. The exception is a
 * remote book the caller reports as loading or failed (options.remoteBook):
 * the result then carries that state at 'medium' or above, because a silent
 * check would read as "every recipient checked".
