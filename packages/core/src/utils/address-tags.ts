/**
 * Address Tagging Utilities
 *
 * Provides human-readable labels for known contract addresses.
 * Tags can come from two sources:
 *   - 'built-in':     hardcoded protocol/Safe contracts shipped with this library
 *   - 'address-book': loaded at runtime from a signer's CSV address book
 *
 * Both sources share the same underlying map. When both exist for the same
 * address, callers can use `getAddressTags()` to retrieve both and render
 * them together (see UI <Address> component).
